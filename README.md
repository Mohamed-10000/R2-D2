 Our project is simply a robot that detects human face by camera module, consequently it stops, actuating a motor that ejects a flyer that is meant to provide info or advertise whatever organization. It has a proximity sensor that detects any obstacle and stops avoiding the collision and changes its direction within the pre trajected area.
